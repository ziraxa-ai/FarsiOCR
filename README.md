FarsiOCR – Persian Alphabet Recognition
English
Project Description

FarsiOCR is a research-oriented project focused on recognizing Persian handwritten alphabet letters using machine learning. The system employs three different datasets and evaluates a wide range of machine learning models. By comparing and optimizing these models, the project aims to investigate their performance and propose improvements for more accurate recognition.

Key Features

Uses 3 datasets of Persian handwritten characters.

Benchmarks multiple machine learning models (ANN, CNN, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression).

Implements ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) for improved performance.

Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation tools.
